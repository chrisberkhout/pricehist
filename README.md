# PriceDB Get

Get historical prices for use in [GnuCash](https://www.gnucash.org/) and
[Ledger CLI](https://www.ledger-cli.org/).

## Purpose

This tool can fetch historical price data from multiple sources, for specific
time ranges. It focuses on low-resolution data: just a single price per day,
per commodity pair.

The time range can be specified manually or be deduced from the prices in an
existing file. It can format the fetched prices for Ledger CLI, or insert them
into an SQL-based GnuCash file.
